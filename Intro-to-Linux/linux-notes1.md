##  What I’ve Learned So Far

This was my first real experience working with the Linux terminal. I’ve heard so much about Linux in cybersecurity, and now I get why everyone says it’s important.
Here are the key things I learned:

### Linux Basics
- Linux is lightweight and flexible.
- It’s mostly command-line based (which felt scary at first but is actually cool).
- It was released in 1991 and is inspired by UNIX.

###  Commands I Practiced

~BASH
whoami         # Shows the user I'm logged in as
ls             # Lists files/folders in the directory
cd             # Changes directory (like navigating folders)
pwd            # Shows the current directory path
cat filename   # Displays the content of a file
touch file     # Creates a new empty file
mkdir folder   # Creates a new folder

~FINDING ABD SEARCHING
find . -name "*.txt"       # Find all .txt files in current and subfolders
grep "password" notes.txt  # Search for 'password' inside a file
wc -l file.txt             # Count the number of lines in a file

~OPERATORS
(>)	Redirects output (overwrite)
(>>)	Redirects output (append)
(&)	Runs command in background
(&&)	Runs multiple commands in sequence


## 📝 Notes:
These are the core commands I practiced during the **TryHackMe: Linux Fundamentals** room.  
I'm now comfortable using the terminal for file operations, directory navigation, and searching content.
